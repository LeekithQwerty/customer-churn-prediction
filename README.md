# customer-churn-prediction

Name: Telco churn dataset

# Aim 
To correctly predict if the customer is going to churn or not

# Learning
Though an easy and straight forward project, I learnt a lot about sampling techniques and the correct way to use them. This was a project where in I experimented a lot with the dataset to find the correct combination features. Telco churn dataset contains details on a hypothetical telecom provider that served 7,043 customers in California in the third quarter by offering home phone and Internet services. It displays which clients have cancelled, stayed, or joined their service. I got a better understanding of the need of inferring from results like ROC, Confusion matrix. As the accuracy of the model was not high, it was of utmost importance to analyse other metrics. It was more crucial to predict customers that will churn correctly as opposed to a customer who wonâ€™t churn correctly. Hence confusion matrix of different models was analysed for the same. Therefore optimising the recall was the goal of this project Obtaining a brand-new customer is always more costly than retaining an existing one. Hence predicting if the customer will churn and not letting them churn is the key to a sustained revenue stream.
